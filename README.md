This is an example-by-example walkthrough of Christian Queinnec's 1996 textbook _Lisp In Small Pieces_, which I am using to review the techniques for imlementing interpreters and compilers for Lisp family languagaes. The book focuses primarily in Scheme variants, but does discuss the design decisions of other languages in the family, especially Common Lisp and LeLisp.

This is meant as a review of techniques which I intend to apply to the Elan translator core, which in turn is meant to support the language experiments for Apophasi, which is itself meant to test language design concepts for Thelema, which is meant to... **insert _Inception_ sound effect here**

I will probably only proceed up to a certain point, though just what that point will be isn't clear yet. The main goal is to get through past at least chapter 9 which discusses implementing macros, as that is the topic I am currently concerned with most (as I mean to use the same methods internally in Elan for handling the template-based representations for special forms as a way to avoid hard-coding them).
